## Large Language Models for Indian Legal Text Summarisation
Summarizing legal case judgments is a
complex task in Legal Natural Language Processing
(NLP), with a gap in understanding how various
summarization models, including extractive and ab-
stractive approaches,perform within the domain of
legal documents. Since there are around 4 crore
pending cases in the Indian court system, this study
addresses the challenge of laborious task of manually
summarizing legal documents. It introduces both
supervised and unsupervised models for both ex-
tractive and abstractive summarization, showcasing
their effective performance through evaluations using
ROUGE metrics and BERT score. BART, T5, PE-
GASUS, ROBERTA, Legal-PEGASUS, Legal-BERT
models are used for abstractive summarisation. Tex-
tRank, LexRank, LSA, Summarizer BERT, KL-
Summ are used in case of extractive summarisation.
Longformer, Bert - Legal Pegasus are also considered
for the task of Summarisation. In the domain of
legal document summarization, we used GPT-4 and
LLAMA-2, employing prompt engineering with both
Zero-shot and One-shot prompts to extract sum-
maries. As far of our knowledge, this is the first paper
that used Large Language Models like GPT-4 and
LLama-2 for the task of Legal Text summarisation.
Along with that a user-friendly chatbot has been
developed utilizing the Llama model and specifically
designed to respond for queries related to legal texts.
Additionally, a web application has been created,
allowing users to upload legal documents for sum-
marization. An option is given to users to select from
various languages including Telugu, Tamil, Kannada,
Malayalam, and Hindi. As a result the summarised
text is converted into respective language.
